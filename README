This is my first experiment with Google's PlayN and a try to revive my rusty
java skills. I choose an old classic to concentrate on the programming.

Open TODOs:
- The score is not calculated correctly
- The AsteroidManager just moves Asteroids to the inactive queue but never back
- the score and level of the last game should be seen in the GameOverGameState (or 0 when there is no last game)
- transition the units of all GameElements from pixels to absolute screen values (from 0.0 to 1.0)

Nice to haves:
- implement hiscores
- implement UFOs
